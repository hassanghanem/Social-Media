                            Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service
                            on which users post and interact with messages known as "tweets".
                            Registered users can post, like and retweet tweets, but unregistered
                            users can only read them. Users access Twitter through its website
                            interface or its mobile-device application software ("app"), though
                            the service could also be accessed via SMS before April 2020.
                            Twitter, Inc. is based in San Francisco, California, and has more
                            than 25 offices around the world.[14] Tweets were originally restricted
                            to 140 characters, but was doubled to 280 for non-CJK languages in
                            November 2017. Audio and video tweets remain limited to 140 seconds
                            for most accounts.
