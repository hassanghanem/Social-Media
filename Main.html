                Social media is interactive digitally-mediated technologies that facilitate the creation or sharing/exchange
                of information, ideas, career interests, and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks.
                While challenges to the definition of social media arise due to the broad variety of stand-alone and built-in
                social-media services currently available, there are some common features:
                Social media are interactive Web 2.0 Internet-based applications.
                User-generated content—such as text posts or comments, digital photos or videos, and data generated through
                all online interactions—is the lifeblood of social media.
                Users create service-specific profiles for the website or app that are designed and maintained by the
                social-media organization.
                Social media facilitate the development of online social networks by connecting a user's profile with those
                of other individuals or groups.
                Users usually access social media services via web-based apps on desktops and laptops, or download services
                that offer social media functionality to their mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets). As users 
                engage with these electronic services, they create highly interactive platforms through which individuals,
                communities, and organizations can share, co-create, discuss, participate, and modify user-generated content
                or self-curated content posted online. Additionally, social media are used to document memories; learn
                about and explore things; advertise oneself; and form friendships along with the growth of ideas from the 
                creation of blogs, podcasts, videos, and gaming sites. This changing relationship between human and
                technology is the focus of the emerging field of technoself studies.
                Some of the most popular social media websites, with over 100 million registered users, include Facebook
                (and its associated Facebook Messenger), TikTok, WeChat, Instagram, QZone, Weibo, Twitter, Tumblr, Baidu Tieba,
                and LinkedIn. Depending on interpretation, other popular platforms that are sometimes referred to as social
                media services include YouTube, QQ, Quora, Telegram, WhatsApp, LINE, Snapchat, Pinterest, Viber, Reddit,
                Discord, VK, Microsoft Teams, and more. Wikis are examples of collaborative content creation.
                Social media outlets differ from traditional media (e.g., print magazines and newspapers, and TV and radio broadcasting)
                in many ways, including quality, reach, frequency, usability, immediacy, and permanence. Additionally, social media
                outlets operate in a dialogic transmission system (i.e., many sources to many receivers), while traditional media outlets
                operate under a monologic transmission model (one source to many receivers). For example, a newspaper is delivered to many
                subscribers and a radio station broadcasts the same programs to an entire city.
                Observers have noted a wide range of positive and negative impacts of social media use. Social media can help to improve
                an individual's sense of connectedness with real or online communities and can be an effective communication (or marketing)
                tool for corporations, entrepreneurs, non-profit organizations, advocacy groups, political parties, and governments.
